GOAL PLANS:
This program is a die game where multiple players roll die and score points.
First player makes the moves for their turn, then continues to another player.
The player that reaches 50 points wins, or whoever has the most points after five turns of playing.
Follow directions within the program.

AT THE MOMENT: 
The program is keeping track of player info well but rerolls only include rolling one number at a time every reroll instead of rolling all numbers over again.
Game does not end at 50 points.
